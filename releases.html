            Velvet May returns on “Tears on Waves” with his third and latest EP
            “Phoebe’s White Skin” to be released on January 2020. The new record
            comes out with a new touch and research of new sounds, making this
            EP a good bond of EBM, Techno and Post-Punk textures.

            "Unknown Bodies" tell us a story, a contorted story of lust and
            infernal gazes, yet divine that spread infamy and glory, grief and
            bliss. A story of lost inhibitions and sensations. A story of
            burning breasts. Now is the time when each flower fades away like
            incense and sounds and scents turn in the evening air. “Bodies
            entwined Hearts resounding The shivers of sweat Coming and going”
            The artist wants to show something. A natural desire which finds its
            fulfillment in the body, but that instantaneously dies at the end of
            the sensations. Sensations too much strong to last so much time.
            That’s exactly why he doesn’t never renounce to let go his
            inhibitions completely, having fear to be burnt, devoured and thrown
            in the deep end. On the B side, the original tracks find a
            completely different vision, but especially a new light, leading the
            listener to a different path of the same perverse and twisted
            nature.

            The constant pursuit and research for something that is inside of us
            creates motivation and knowledge of our experiences. The knowledge
            of our fears, emotions and beliefs take us to be part of a little
            elite of persons that face the reality in another way. In this one
            there are few which romantically look for an inspiration in a muse,
            a venal muse that in a vast and black night and sinuous as a swan
            will warm our shoulders and make our deepest good and bad
            experiences come up, creating a vortex of emotions that get
            translated in music. Velvet May makes his debut EP go around aspects
            like love, liberation, pleasure, dependence and essence and he does
            it in the stark drama of his living mind. There a no
            simplifications, everything is translated without polishings and
            shades, but with respect to his real essence. The Venal Muse is
            always present and gives birth to big pleasures and life
            representations, but at the same time, with eyes full of mud, to
            mind perversions and reality collapses, generating a contrast which
            leads the artist to another state of his mind. The music talks, it
            doesn’t lie and able to solve many cold and unsolved enigmas of the
            life, like a flower among many complexes, give reasons to the
            dramatic mind to live and generate something that is far away from
            the reality, spreading pleasures for all concerned.

            Ethereal, hypnotic and deep textures coexist on heavy and good
            composed grooves, making the first installment of this catalogue a
            new identity, for a long time researched, of the artist. The first
            installment of the new label of the italian based-in-Berlin artist
            has the mission to propose a new entity that, long researched and
            experimented, goes off the grid representing a new way to touch
            listeners and to spread emotions. Thus there is a need to create a
            new dimension where the artist feels at home.
